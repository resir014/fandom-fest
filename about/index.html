                <p>The fans of pop culture such as TV series, movie, etc are a strong basis of the rapidly growing <em>fandom</em> communities in our everyday life. As a <em>joint</em> project between many <em>fandom</em> communities, Fandom Festival is a 2-day event for people with shared interest in pop culture to gather and channel their creative energy. Started as small gathering events in some fandom communities, we came together to create this event where everyone can join in the fun and find their creative passion!</p>
